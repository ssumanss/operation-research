Rest marks are part of continuous assessment that belongs to attendance, seminar and assignments. Practice the following question for exams Unit 1 Calculating contour integral using parametrization of curve. Use path independence when antiderivative exists. Use Cauchy theorem when function is analytic Unit 2 Use Cauchy integral formula to find integration along closed contour. Use Cauchy integral formula to find integration along closed contour. Internal Exam \u00b6 Internal exam consist of 5 objectives and 3 descriptive questions, out of which you have to answer all objectives and 2 descriptive questions. Final Exam \u00b6 Final exam divided in three groups. The questions are organized in three groups as follows: Group Questions Marks Total A 10/10 2 20 B 04/05 5 20 C 03/05 10 30","title":"Exam"},{"location":"exam/#exams","text":"The course has two exams one is internal of 15 marks, while the other is final worth 70 marks.
